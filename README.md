# 📊 Charity Donation Tracking — 2025 (Anonymized Preview Dataset)






# 📌 Overview

In 2025, I was assigned the responsibility of tracking monthly fixed-amount charity donations for a group of 200 individuals. The actual dataset spans the entire year and includes detailed contribution history for each donor.

To protect the privacy of the real participants, this repository contains an anonymized preview sheet.
All names, mobile numbers, and identifying information have been replaced with fictional placeholders.
No real personal data has been included.

This mock dataset mirrors the structure and organization of the real records while ensuring full confidentiality.

# 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

All names are artificially generated.

All mobile numbers are randomly created.

None of the entries represent real people.

The real dataset is stored securely and not shared publicly.

This repository is strictly for demonstration, documentation, and development purposes.
